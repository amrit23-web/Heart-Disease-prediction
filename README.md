# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various input features. It utilizes a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction project consists of the following components:

1. `trained_model.sav`: This file contains the trained machine learning model for heart disease prediction. It is used to make predictions based on input data.

2. `app.py`: This Python script sets up a web interface using the Streamlit framework. It allows users to input various parameters and get a prediction for heart disease.

3. `index.html`: This HTML file is the front-end interface for the web application. It provides a form for users to input the required parameters.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
